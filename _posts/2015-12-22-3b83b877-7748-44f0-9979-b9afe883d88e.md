No Idea Unturned

I just heard on a podcast today a wonderful idea about how to start a niche business with no plan or idea or anything. 

The podcast was \#SPI number 192 about types of passive income generation. It went by very fast in the 2x fashion that I consume most info-casts, but it was a bit of genius. 

The insight was that it doesn't take an idea, it takes a mindset. Their advice was just to cold-call businesses and ask about pain points. 

* What is costing them too much time or money? 
* Why is that a problem for their business? 
* What kind of value would they see in this improvement or that?

You probably only get a few people to engage, but what it does is build up a relationship where someone is open to working with a design-thinking problem solver -- dedicated to that one business.
