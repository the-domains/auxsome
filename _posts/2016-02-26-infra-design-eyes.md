# Infra-design Eyes

Here's the thing I'm trying to remember every day.

Just because I look something on the web and see 11 things that are gross, shining examples of terrible practices on an otherwise fair and acceptable design, doesn't mean everyone else can see them too. It's the downside of studying anything closely, from art or film to botany or engineering. You just start to see things that others don't notice.

I'm sure that there are legions of people out there that were unable to resist reading about "10 universal plot lines of every hollywood film" and for a while were not able to watch movies without seeing them appear over and over. (Lately, I've been fascinated with spotting logical fallacies.)

But back to the design. There's a terrible side effect for the cobblers-of-the-web out there. It affects those of us that can see all the ways things can be done wrong first.

Ultra-design goggles can be paralyzing. The fear of mucking everything up, of being a professional designer and not following "form design 101 best-practices" can push back on you so hard that you never leave the starting block.

> When it's trivially easy to be critical of other people's work, it's usually your own that is receiving the harshest treatment.

So forgive yourself an asterisk or two, and make sure that you give yourself permission to make a design mistake here or a copy flub there. None of it is permanent, and none of it is an excuse to fail to start. Even if it's a terrible start. Even if it's naive and mis-guided and way beyond your reach.

Even if you fall out of bed, you're up.
